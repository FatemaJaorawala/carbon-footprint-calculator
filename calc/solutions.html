            <p>University of Colorado Boulder engineers are using microalgae to make carbon-neutral cement. Cement production is responsible for 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The team aims to replace traditional limestone with calcium carbonate derived from photosynthetic microalgae called coccolithophores, which naturally store carbon.</p>

            <p>Scientists at the University of Cambridge and Imperial College London have created a device that generates hydrogen from water using sunlight. This "artificial leaf" can split water into oxygen and hydrogen for 240 hours, without any additional energy input, potentially leading to green hydrogen production.</p>

            <p>Researchers at the University of Cambridge developed a coin-sized supercapacitor made from coconut shells and saltwater that can capture CO2 from the air. By improving the charging process, this device absorbs carbon more efficiently, potentially offering a cheaper and more sustainable alternative to current carbon capture methods.</p>
